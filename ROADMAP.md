# Roadmap

This is a rough roadmap of where this project might be heading. Nothing is set in stone, and priorities can change based on feedback and contributions.

## Current State (v2.0.1)

✅ **Working well:**

- Basic MCP server functionality
- File operations and command execution
- Context storage and retrieval
- Task management system
- Most day-to-day tools

## Short Term (Next Few Months)

🎯 **High Priority:**

- [ ] Fix any critical bugs that come up
- [ ] Improve documentation based on user feedback
- [ ] Make setup process easier for new users
- [ ] Better error handling and user experience
- [ ] Performance testing with large projects

🔍 **Need to Figure Out:**

- [ ] Is the autonomous monitoring system actually useful?
- [ ] Should this be split into multiple smaller MCP servers?
- [ ] What are the most common use cases people have?

## Medium Term (If This Actually Takes Off)

💡 **Ideas to Explore:**

- [ ] Plugin system for custom tools
- [ ] Better integration with different IDEs
- [ ] Collaboration features for team usage
- [ ] More intelligent context management
- [ ] Integration with other AI tools/services

🏗️ **Architecture:**

- [ ] Consider refactoring to microservices if it gets too complex
- [ ] Better configuration management
- [ ] More comprehensive testing
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization

## Long Term (Dreams and Maybes)

🚀 **Big Ideas:**

- [ ] Visual configuration interface
- [ ] Marketplace for community tools
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Multi-language support beyond Node.js
- [ ] Advanced analytics and insights
