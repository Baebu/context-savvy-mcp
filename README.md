# Context Savvy MCP üß†‚ú®

_The AI assistant's best friend - because even Claude needs a good memory_

## The Problem That Wouldn't Go Away

You know that feeling when you're deep in a coding session with Claude, everything's flowing perfectly, and then... üí• Context limit hit. Your conversation gets truncated. The AI forgets what you were working on. All that beautiful, collaborative momentum? Gone.

Or maybe you're the type who switches between projects constantly (guilty üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), and every time you start a new chat, you have to re-explain your entire setup, your file structure, your preferences, your... everything.

**What if your AI assistant could remember?** Not just remember, but truly _understand_ your projects, maintain context across conversations, and actually _help_ you stay organized?

That's exactly why this exists.

## What This Thing Actually Does

Context Savvy MCP is a turbocharged memory system for Claude Desktop that turns your AI assistant into something that feels almost... permanent. Instead of starting from scratch every conversation, Claude can:

- **Remember everything** across chat sessions (your projects, preferences, ongoing work)
- **Execute commands safely** (because sometimes you need to actually _do_ things, not just talk about them)
- **Manage files intelligently** (read, write, search, organize - all with context awareness)
- **Learn from your patterns** (it gets smarter about how you work over time)
- **Keep itself organized** (autonomous maintenance, cleanup, optimization)

Think of it as giving Claude a persistent workspace and a really, really good memory.

## The Magic in Action üé©

**Scenario 1: Project Continuity**

```
You (in Chat #1): "Help me refactor this React component..."
[Work gets done, chat ends naturally]

You (in Chat #47, two weeks later): "Hey, what was I working on?"
Claude: "You were refactoring the UserProfile component.
You'd gotten the props interface done and were working on the state management.
Should we continue where we left off?"
```

**Scenario 2: Context-Aware File Operations**

```
You: "Find all the TODO comments in my project"
Claude: [Searches across your entire codebase] "Found 23 TODOs.
The urgent ones are in auth.ts and database.service.ts.
Want me to show you those first?"

You: "Fix the auth one"
Claude: [Opens file, understands context, makes intelligent suggestions]
"I see the issue - you're missing error handling in the token validation. Here's a fix..."
```

**Scenario 3: Learning Your Workflow**

```
After a few weeks of use...

Claude: "I noticed you always run tests after refactoring. Should I go ahead and run them now?"
You: "Yes! And check the coverage while you're at it."
Claude: [Executes tests, analyzes coverage, provides detailed report]
"All green! Coverage increased by 2.3%. The new code is well-tested."
```

## Why This Exists (The Real Story)

I got tired of explaining my setup to Claude every. single. time.

I'm a developer who juggles multiple projects, has strong opinions about code organization, and relies heavily on AI assistance for the tedious stuff. But every new conversation meant starting over - re-explaining my file structure, my preferences, my coding standards, what I was working on.

So I built this. Initially just for me, with too much coffee and stubborn determination.

Turns out, having an AI assistant with persistent memory and the ability to actually _do_ things (not just suggest them) changes everything. Conversations flow naturally. Work gets done faster. Context never gets lost.

**The honest truth:** This started as a personal tool and grew into something that might actually be useful to other developers. It works well for me, but I'm curious if it resonates with anyone else.

## Quick Reality Check ‚úã

**What definitely works:**

- Persistent context across Claude conversations
- Safe command execution with security boundaries
- Intelligent file operations and project management
- Task tracking and workflow automation
- Most of the daily-use features I depend on

**What might be quirky:**

- The autonomous monitoring (new, needs more testing)
- Complex task workflows (works, but UX could be better)
- Performance with massive projects (it's good, but not tested at enterprise scale)
- Setup process (functional, but could be smoother)

**What I'm genuinely curious about:**

- Is this actually useful to other developers?
- Are there better patterns I should be using?
- Should this be one big server or split into smaller focused ones?
- What features are missing that would make this indispensable?

## Getting Started (The Actually Quick Version)

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, Claude Desktop, and 5 minutes

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/Baebu/context-savvy-mcp.git
cd context-savvy-mcp
npm install

# One-command setup (handles everything)
npm run quick-setup
```

The setup script will:

- Build the project ‚öôÔ∏è
- Create example configurations üìù
- Run tests to make sure everything works ‚úÖ
- Show you exactly what to add to Claude Desktop üìã

**Add to Claude Desktop config:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context-server": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/your/context-savvy-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_CONFIG_PATH": "/path/to/your/context-savvy-mcp/config/server.yaml"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop, and you're off to the races.

## The Architecture (For Fellow Code Nerds)

Built with clean architecture principles because I have opinions about code organization:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Pure business logic, no dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application/    # Use cases, services, workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/ # Database, file system, external APIs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/   # MCP protocol interface
```

**Tech stack:** TypeScript, SQLite, TensorFlow.js (for embeddings), Dependency Injection, way too much attention to detail.

**Design philosophy:** Make it work first, make it elegant second, make it fast third. Currently somewhere between steps 2 and 3.

## Security (Because I'm Paranoid)

- **Command whitelisting:** Only approved commands can run
- **Path sandboxing:** File operations restricted to safe zones
- **Input validation:** Everything gets cleaned and checked
- **Audit logging:** Track what happens and when
- **User consent:** Potentially risky operations require confirmation

The default config is locked down tight. You explicitly allow what you want.

## Want to Help? ü§ù

**I'm genuinely looking for:**
