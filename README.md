# Context Savvy MCP üß†‚ú®

_The AI assistant's best friend - because even Claude needs a good memory_

## The Problem That Wouldn't Go Away

You know that feeling when you're deep in a coding session with Claude, everything's flowing perfectly, and then... üí• **Context limit hit.** Your conversation gets truncated. The AI forgets what you were working on. All that beautiful, collaborative momentum? Gone.

Or maybe you're the type who switches between projects constantly (guilty üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), and every time you start a new chat, you have to re-explain your entire setup, your file structure, your preferences, your... everything.

**What if your AI assistant could remember?** Not just remember, but truly _understand_ your projects, maintain context across conversations, and actually _help_ you stay organized?

That's exactly why this exists.

## What This Thing Actually Does

Context Savvy MCP is a turbocharged memory system for Claude Desktop that turns your AI assistant into something that feels almost... permanent. Instead of starting from scratch every conversation, Claude can:

- **Remember everything** across chat sessions (your projects, preferences, ongoing work)
- **Execute commands safely** (because sometimes you need to actually _do_ things, not just talk about them)
- **Manage files intelligently** (read, write, search, organize - all with context awareness)
- **Learn from your patterns** (it gets smarter about how you work over time)
- **Keep itself organized** (autonomous maintenance, cleanup, optimization)

Think of it as giving Claude a persistent workspace and a really, really good memory.

## The Magic in Action üé©

**Scenario 1: Project Continuity**

```
You (in Chat #1): "Help me refactor this React component..."
[Work gets done, chat ends naturally]

You (in Chat #47, two weeks later): "Hey, what was I working on?"
Claude: "You were refactoring the UserProfile component. You'd gotten the props interface done and were working on the state management. Should we continue where we left off?"
```

**Scenario 2: Context-Aware File Operations**

```
You: "Find all the TODO comments in my project"
Claude: [Searches across your entire codebase] "Found 23 TODOs. The urgent ones are in auth.ts and database.service.ts. Want me to show you those first?"

You: "Fix the auth one"
Claude: [Opens file, understands context, makes intelligent suggestions] "I see the issue - you're missing error handling in the token validation. Here's a fix..."
```

**Scenario 3: Learning Your Workflow**

```
After a few weeks of use...

Claude: "I noticed you always run tests after refactoring. Should I go ahead and run them now?"
You: "Yes! And check the coverage while you're at it."
Claude: [Executes tests, analyzes coverage, provides detailed report] "All green! Coverage increased by 2.3%. The new code is well-tested."
```

## Why This Exists (The Real Story)

I got tired of explaining my setup to Claude every. single. time.

I'm a developer who juggles multiple projects, has strong opinions about code organization, and relies heavily on AI assistance for the tedious stuff. But every new conversation meant starting over - re-explaining my file structure, my preferences, my coding standards, what I was working on.

So I built this. Initially just for me, with too much coffee and stubborn determination.

Turns out, having an AI assistant with persistent memory and the ability to actually _do_ things (not just suggest them) changes everything. Conversations flow naturally. Work gets done faster. Context never gets lost.

**The honest truth:** This started as a personal tool and grew into something that might actually be useful to other developers. It works well for me, but I'm curious if it resonates with anyone else.

## Quick Reality Check ‚úã

**What definitely works:**

- Persistent context across Claude conversations
- Safe command execution with security boundaries
- Intelligent file operations and project management
- Task tracking and workflow automation
- Most of the daily-use features I depend on

**What might be quirky:**

- The autonomous monitoring (new, needs more testing)
- Complex task workflows (works, but UX could be better)
- Performance with massive projects (it's good, but not tested at enterprise scale)
- Setup process (functional, but could be smoother)

**What I'm genuinely curious about:**

- Is this actually useful to other developers?
- Are there better patterns I should be using?
- Should this be one big server or split into smaller focused ones?
- What features are missing that would make this indispensable?

## The Architecture (For Fellow Code Nerds)

Built with clean architecture principles because I have opinions about code organization:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Pure business logic, no dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ application/    # Use cases, services, workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ infrastructure/ # Database, file system, external APIs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/   # MCP protocol interface
```

**Tech stack:** TypeScript, SQLite, TensorFlow.js (for embeddings), Dependency Injection, way too much attention to detail.

**Design philosophy:** Make it work first, make it elegant second, make it fast third. Currently somewhere between steps 2 and 3.

## Security (Because I'm Paranoid)

This server operates on a "trust but verify" model, configured entirely by you. There are no runtime pop-ups or consent dialogs; security is handled by your `config/server.yaml` file.

- **Command Whitelisting:** Only commands explicitly listed in your configuration's `allowedCommands` can be executed. Everything else is blocked by default.
- **Path Sandboxing (Safe Zones):** File operations are restricted to directories you define in `safezones`. By default, this is "recursive," meaning subdirectories are also accessible.
- **Restricted Zones:** The server maintains a list of sensitive system paths (`/etc`, `C:\Windows`, etc.) and project paths (`.git`, `.ssh`) that are always blocked, even if they fall within a safe zone.
- **Input Validation:** All file paths and command arguments are sanitized to prevent common injection and path traversal attacks.

The default config is locked down tight. You explicitly allow what you want, giving you full control over the server's capabilities.

## Want to Help? ü§ù

**I'm genuinely looking for:**

- **Testing:** Try it with your projects, break it, tell me what happens
- **Code review:** I have blind spots, you probably see them
- **Ideas:** What features would make this indispensable for you?
- **Documentation:** If something doesn't make sense, let me know
- **Real-world feedback:** Does this actually solve problems you have?

**Good first contributions:**

- Try the setup process and document any friction
- Test with different project types and report what works/doesn't
- Add support for your favorite tools or languages
- Improve error messages and UX
- Write tests for edge cases I missed

**To contribute:**

```bash
# Fork on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/context-savvy-mcp.git
cd context-savvy-mcp
npm install
npm test    # Make sure everything works
npm run dev # Start hacking
```

## Configuration & Customization

The system is controlled by `config/server.yaml`. Here's what you can tune:

```yaml
# Security boundaries
security:
  allowedCommands: ['ls', 'git status', 'npm test']
  safezones: ['~/projects/my-web-app', './workspace']

# Database and storage
database:
  path: './data/context.db'
  backupInterval: 360 # In minutes. 0 to disable.

# Semantic search features
semanticSearch:
  enabled: true
  model: 'universal-sentence-encoder'

# Autonomous behaviors
autonomous:
  enabled: true
  monitoring:
    compressionThreshold: 10240 # In bytes. Auto-compress contexts larger than this.
    panicThreshold: 0.95 # Trigger emergency state save at 95% of context window.
```

Run `npm run config` for a web-based configuration UI. For a full breakdown of options, see the [Installation Guide](./INSTALLATION.md).

## The Honest FAQ

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: For personal use? Absolutely. For enterprise? Probably needs more testing and hardening.

**Q: Why not use [existing solution]?**
A: I tried. Nothing gave me the exact combination of persistence, security, and workflow integration I wanted.

**Q: Will this slow down Claude?**
A: In my experience, no. The context loading is fast, and having persistent memory actually makes conversations more efficient.

**Q: What if I find bugs?**
A: Please report them! I use this daily, so bugs get fixed quickly.

**Q: Can I use this for commercial projects?**
A: MIT license, so yes. Just don't blame me if something breaks.
