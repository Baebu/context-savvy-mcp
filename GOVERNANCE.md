# Project Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the Context-Savy-Server project.

## Project Roles

### Maintainers

Maintainers have write access to the repository and are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Triaging issues
- Making and approving architectural decisions
- Creating releases and managing the release process
- Ensuring the project adheres to its standards and roadmap

Current maintainers:

- [Your Name/Username] (Project Lead)
<!-- Add additional maintainers as needed -->

### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute to the project through code, documentation, bug reports, or other means. Anyone can become a contributor by:

- Submitting and having pull requests merged
- Contributing documentation
- Helping with issue triage
- Helping other users in discussions

## Decision Making Process

### Technical Decisions

For day-to-day technical decisions:

1. Decisions are made through pull requests and issue discussions
2. Maintainers have the final say on technical decisions
3. Consensus is preferred, but not required

### Project Direction

For significant changes to project direction:

1. A proposal should be created as a GitHub issue with the "proposal" label
2. The proposal must remain open for discussion for at least one week
3. Maintainers will make the final decision based on community feedback

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who have made significant and valuable contributions can be nominated to become maintainers:

1. An existing maintainer nominates a contributor
2. A simple majority vote of existing maintainers is required
3. New maintainers must demonstrate:
   - Deep understanding of the project's code and architecture
   - A history of constructive contributions
   - Commitment to the project's success

## Releases

Releases follow this process:

1. Maintainers determine when a release is needed
2. A release candidate is created for testing
3. After testing and approval, the final release is published
4. The CHANGELOG.md is updated with detailed release notes

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the project are expected to follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Changes to Governance

Changes to this governance document require:

1. A proposal as a pull request
2. At least a one-week review period
3. Approval by a majority of maintainers
