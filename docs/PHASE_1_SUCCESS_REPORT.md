## 🏗️ Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Enhancements
```sql
-- New tables created:
- migrations (version tracking)
- context_blocks (chunked vector storage)  
- sessions (session management)
- context_relationships (semantic relationships)
- plugin_registry (dynamic tool management)

-- Enhanced existing table:
- context_items (added relevance_score, access_count)

-- Performance indexes:
- Query optimization indexes
- Vector search preparation
- Session management optimization
```

### Performance Improvements
```javascript
// LRU Cache Implementation
const embeddingCache = new LRUCache({
  max: 1000,
  ttl: 1000 * 60 * 60 // 1 hour
});

// Database Optimizations
db.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');
// Strategic performance indexes added
```

### Configuration Framework
```yaml
# server-v2.yaml highlights
server:
  version: 2.0.0
vectorStorage:
  enabled: true
semanticSearch:
  enabled: true
memory:
  maxMemoryMB: 512
  cacheSize: 1000
features:
  fastmcpIntegration: true
  semanticMemory: true
```
