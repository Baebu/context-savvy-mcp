## 🚀 Quick Start Configuration

Copy this configuration to your Claude Desktop preferences to get optimal performance with context-savvy-server:

```
# Context-Savvy Server - Optimal Configuration

## Environment Setup
- Auto-detect OS and shell (Windows/macOS/Linux compatible)
- Context-server tools as primary workspace system
- Automatic safe zone expansion for your projects
- Token-optimized operations for faster responses

## Token Efficiency (Essential for Performance)
- **Smart Search First**: Use compact_search for 96% token reduction
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple tasks efficiently
- **Auto-Compression**: Compress large contexts automatically
- **Budget Management**: Maintain <80% token usage automatically
- **Progressive Detail**: Show summaries first, expand only when needed

## Getting Started Protocol
1. **First Session**: execute_startup_recovery (restores your workspace)
2. **Health Check**: get_system_health (ensures everything is working)
3. **Auto-Monitor**: enable_autonomous_monitoring (self-managing system)
4. **Project Setup**: init_projects_directory (organize your work)

## Essential File Operations
- **Safe Access**: Automatic safe zone expansion for your directories
- **Smart Search**: compact_search finds what you need quickly
- **Intelligent Editing**: precision_edit makes surgical changes safely
- **Project Analysis**: get_project_overview understands your codebase
- **Auto-Backup**: Files are safely recycled, not permanently deleted

## Best Practices for New Users
- **Start Small**: Begin with one project directory
- **Use Search**: Always search before making changes
- **Trust Automation**: Let the system manage token usage and maintenance
- **Build Gradually**: Create workspaces as you work on different projects
- **Review Changes**: Use preview mode before applying edits

## Communication Style
- Ask for project overviews to understand codebases
- Request compact searches for quick information
- Use batch operations for multiple related tasks
- Expect brief confirmations for simple operations
- Get detailed explanations when needed with expand_search_result
```

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup Instructions

### 1. **Initial System Configuration**

After installing context-savvy-server, have Claude run these commands on first use:

```
1. execute_startup_recovery
2. get_system_health
3. init_projects_directory
4. enable_autonomous_monitoring
```

### 2. **Configure Your Main Project Directory**

Tell Claude: "Set up my main projects directory at [your_path]" and it will:

- Auto-expand safe zones for access
- Create workspace integration
- Set up automatic file tracking
- Configure backup and recovery

### 3. **Essential Daily Workflow**

**For File Analysis:**

- "Give me a project overview of [directory]"
- "Search for [pattern] in my codebase"
- "Find files related to [functionality]"

**For Code Changes:**

- "Search for [issue] and show me compact results"
- "Make precise edits to fix [problem]"
- "Create a workspace for [new_project]"

### 4. **Token Optimization Settings**

The system automatically:

- ✅ Uses compact_search (96% token reduction)
- ✅ Compresses large contexts
- ✅ Manages token budget intelligently
- ✅ Archives old data automatically
- ✅ Deduplicates similar contexts
